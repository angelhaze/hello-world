UCLA Art student looking to learn more about how to code for personal projects: projections, meme art, websites, etc. As well as for making more work based things like apps and UI/UX for non-profits

I don't have any experience but I want to immerse myself in as much as I can. I am actually really excited to learn more from different people and how I can then later contribute to a whole community.
